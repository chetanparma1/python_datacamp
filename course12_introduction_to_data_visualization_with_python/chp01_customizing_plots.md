# Chapter 01: Customizing Plots

## 01. Multiple plots on single axis
It is time now to put together some of what you have learned and combine line plots on a common set of axes. The data set here comes from records of undergraduate degrees awarded to women in a variety of fields from 1970 to 2011. You can compare trends in degrees most easily by viewing two curves on the same set of axes.

Here, three NumPy arrays have been pre-loaded for you: year (enumerating years from 1970 to 2011 inclusive), physical_sciences (representing the percentage of Physical Sciences degrees awarded to women each in corresponding year), and computer_science (representing the percentage of Computer Science degrees awarded to women in each corresponding year).

You will issue two plt.plot() commands to draw line plots of different colors on the same set of axes. Here, year represents the x-axis, while `physical_sciences` and `computer_science` are the y-axes.
