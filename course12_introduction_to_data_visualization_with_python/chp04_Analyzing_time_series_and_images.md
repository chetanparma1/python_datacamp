# Chapter 01: Analyzing Time Series and Images

## 01. Multiple time series on common axes
For this exercise, you will construct a plot showing four time series stocks on the same axes. The time series in question are represented in the session using the identifiers `aapl`, `ibm`, csco, and msft. You'll generate a single plot showing all the time series on common axes with a legend.

### Instructions:
* Plot the `aapl` time series in blue with a label of 'AAPL'.
* Plot the `ibm` time series in green with a label of 'IBM'.
* Plot the csco time series in red with a label of 'CSCO'.
* Plot the msft time series in magenta with a label of 'MSFT'.
* Specify a rotation of 60 for the xticks with plt.xticks().
* Add a legend in the 'upper left' corner of the plot.

#### Script:
```
# Import matplotlib.pyplot
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Plot the aapl time series in blue
plt.plot(aapl, color='blue', label='AAPL')

# Plot the ibm time series in green
plt.plot(ibm, color='green', label='IBM')

# Plot the csco time series in red
plt.plot(csco, color='red', label='CSCO')

# Plot the msft time series in magenta
plt.plot(msft, color='magenta', label='MSFT')

# Add a legend in the top left corner of the plot
plt.legend(loc='upper left')

# Specify the orientation of the xticks
plt.xticks(rotation=60)

# Display the plot
plt.show()

```

#### Output:
```

#### Comment:
Great work! It looks like 'AAPL' has done particularly well in recent years!

## 02. Multiple time series slices (1)
You can easily slice subsets corresponding to different time intervals from a time series. In particular, you can use strings like `'2001:2005'`, `'2011-03:2011-12'`, or '2010-04-19:2010-04-30' to extract data from time intervals of length 5 years, 10 months, or 12 days respectively.

* Unlike slicing from standard Python lists, tuples, and strings, when slicing time series by labels (and other pandas Series & DataFrames by labels), the slice includes the right-most portion of the slice. That is, extracting my_time_series['1990':'1995'] extracts data from my_time_series corresponding to 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995 inclusive.
* You can use partial strings or datetime objects for indexing and slicing from time series.
For this exercise, you will use time series slicing to plot the time series aapl over its full 11-year range and also over a shorter 2-year range. You'll arrange these plots in a 2Ã—1 grid of subplots

### Instructions:
* Plot the series `aapl` in `'blue'` in the top subplot of a vertically-stacked pair of subplots, with the xticks rotated to 45 degrees.
* Extract a slice named view from the series aapl containing data from the years 2007 to 2008 (inclusive). This has been done for you.
* Plot the slice view in black in the bottom subplot.

#### Script:
```
# Plot the series in the top subplot in blue
plt.subplot(2,1,1)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.title('AAPL: 2001 to 2011')
plt.plot(aapl, color='blue')

# Slice aapl from '2007' to '2008' inclusive: view
view = aapl['2007':'2008']

# Plot the sliced data in the bottom subplot in black
plt.subplot(2,1,2)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.title('AAPL: 2007 to 2008')
plt.plot(view, color='black')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

#### Comment:
Fantastic! Plotting time series at different intervals can provide you with deeper insight into your data. Here, for example, you can see that the AAPL stock price rose and fell a great amount between 2007 and 2008.
