# Chapter 03: Thinking Probabistically -- Discrete Variables

## 01. What is the goal of statistical inference?

Why do we do statistical inference?

## Possible Answers
* To draw probabilistic conclusions about what we might expect if we collected the same data again.
** press 1
* To draw actionable conclusions from data.
** press 2
* To draw more general conclusions from relatively few data or observations.
** press 3
* All of these.
** press 4

### Answer:
4

#### Comment:
Correct! Statistical inference involves taking your data to probabilistic conclusions about what you would expect if you took even more data, and you can make decisions based on these conclusions.

## 02. Why do we use the language of probability?
Which of the following is not a reason why we use probabilistic language in statistical inference?

### Possible Answers
* Probability provides a measure of uncertainty.
** press 1
* Probabilistic language is not very precise.
** press 2
* Data are almost never exactly the same when acquired again, and probability allows us to say how much we expect them to vary.
** press 3

#### Answer:
2

#### Comment:
Correct. Probabilistic language is in fact very precise. It precisely describes uncertainty.
