Chapter 02: Exploratory Data Analysis

## 01. pandas line plots
In the previous chapter, you saw that the .plot() method will place the Index values on the x-axis by default. In this exercise, you'll practice making line plots with specific columns on the x and y axes.

You will work with a dataset consisting of monthly stock prices in 2015 for AAPL, GOOG, and IBM. The stock prices were obtained from Yahoo Finance. Your job is to plot the 'Month' column on the x-axis and the AAPL and IBM prices on the y-axis using a list of column names.

All necessary modules have been imported for you, and the DataFrame is available in the workspace as df. Explore it using methods such as .head(), .info(), and .describe() to see the column names.

### Instructions:
* Create a list of y-axis column names called y_columns consisting of 'AAPL' and 'IBM'.
* Generate a line plot with x='Month' and y=y_columns as inputs.
* Give the plot a title of 'Monthly stock prices'.
* Specify the y-axis label.
* Display the plot.

#### Script
```
# Create a list of y-axis column names: y_columns
y_columns = ['AAPL', 'IBM']

# Generate a line plot
df.plot(x='Month', y=y_columns)

# Add the title
plt.title('Monthly stock prices')

# Add the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Price ($US)')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```
##### Output:

##### Comment:
Wonderful work! It looks like the monthly stock prices of both AAPL and IBM peaked early in the year before falling.

## 02. pandas scatter plots
Pandas scatter plots are generated using the kind='scatter' keyword argument. Scatter plots require that the x and y columns be chosen by specifying the x and y parameters inside .plot(). Scatter plots also take an s keyword argument to provide the radius of each circle to plot in pixels.

In this exercise, you're going to plot fuel efficiency (miles-per-gallon) versus horse-power for 392 automobiles manufactured from 1970 to 1982 from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The size of each circle is provided as a NumPy array called sizes. This array contains the normalized 'weight' of each automobile in the dataset.

All necessary modules have been imported and the DataFrame is available in the workspace as df.

### Instructions:
* Generate a scatter plot with 'hp' on the x-axis and 'mpg' on the y-axis. Specify s=sizes.
* Add a title to the plot.
* Specify the x-axis and y-axis labels.

#### Script:
```
# Generate a scatter plot
df.plot(kind='scatter', x='hp', y='mpg', s=sizes)

# Add the title
plt.title('Fuel efficiency vs Horse-power')

# Add the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Horse-power')

# Add the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Fuel efficiency (mpg)')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```
##### Output:
![Alt text](./fuel_horse.svg)

##### Comment:
Fantastic! As you would expect, automobiles with higher horsepower are less fuel efficient.
